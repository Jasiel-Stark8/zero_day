In this project I used vagrant in a VB running Ubuntu 20.04 as part of the ALX project.

Commands i used after using the Github web UI to create this repo are:
`cd home/Desktop/jason`
`mkdir vagrant`
`cd vagrant`
`mkdir zero_day`
`cd zero_day`

Now I initialized git in the `zero_day` directory & added the remote origin.
`git init`
`git remote add origin <Copied Https link from repo>`

I then created this `README.md` file.

I added, commited & pushed it.
`git add README.md`
`git commit -m "My first commit" `
`git push`
